**Welcome**

My GitHub space is pretty boring and devoid of content.  Most of my actual code sits behind corporate logins of other git products or on private GitHub Enterprise instances.  That code is considered IP so I can't share.

Until they replace you can see some of my work in the final product of [Moffitt Cancer Center's website](https://moffitt.org).  That website was written primarily in C#, JS, HTML, CSS.  React library is in use in parts. 

I plan to start adding more personal projects and code snippets.  For now you will have to deal with boring. &#128512;
